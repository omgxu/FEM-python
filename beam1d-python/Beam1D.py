"""
Beam1D - 1D beam FE analysis program.
  Element types  : 2-node beam element.
  Problem solved : 1D beam whose Young's modulus, cross-sectinal area and body
  force are lineary interpolated within each element.

Usage:
   >>> Beam1D file_name [BeamType]

Command line arguments:
  file_name: File name in which the FE model is stored in json format
  BeamType  : Optinal. Plot the exact solution of the problem defined by BeamType
    ExactSolution_Cantilever: the cantilever given in Example 10.1 in Fish's textbook

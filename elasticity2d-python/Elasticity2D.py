"""
Elasticity2D - 2-dimension elasticity FE analysis program.
  Element types  : 2-dimension 4-node quadratic(4Q) element.
  Problem solved : 2-dimension plane whose Young's modulus and Poisson's rate are known
    is deformed at boundary forces, nodal forces and body force.

Usage:
   >>> Elasticity2D file_name
or
   $ python Elasticity2D.py file_name

Command line arguments:
  file_name: File name in which the FE model is stored in json format

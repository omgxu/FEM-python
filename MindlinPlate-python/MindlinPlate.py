"""
MindlinPlate - Elastic plate bending FE analysis program.
  Element types  : 4-node quadratic Mindlin plate element.
  Problem solved : plate whose Young's modulus, Poisson's rate and thickness are known
    is deformed at surface pressure, boundary forces, nodal forces and body force.

Usage:
   >>> MindlinPlate file_name
or
   $ python MindlinPlate.py file_name

Command line arguments:
  file_name: File name in which the FE model is stored in json format
